# Microfrontend Architecture

## Benefits of Microfrontend Architecture

Microfrontend architecture divides a large frontend application into smaller, more independent parts that are developed, deployed, and managed by different teams. This brings several advantages:

- **Independent Development and Deployment:** Microfrontends can be developed and deployed independently without affecting other parts of the application. This allows teams to work in parallel and release new features faster.
- **Scalability:** As applications grow, managing a single large codebase becomes challenging. Microfrontends help break down complexity, making it easier to scale the application.
- **Technology Agnosticism:** Each microfrontend can use different JavaScript frameworks or libraries (e.g., React, Angular, Vue.js). This allows teams to choose the best technology for each specific part of the application and easily integrate new technologies.
- **Code Reusability:** Modules and components can be easily shared between microfrontends, reducing code duplication and increasing application consistency.
- **Fault Isolation:** If one microfrontend experiences an issue, it typically doesn't affect the entire application, improving stability and user experience.
- **Improved Performance:** Microfrontends can be loaded independently or lazy-loaded, helping to reduce the initial load time of the application.
- **Clear Separation of Concerns:** Each team is fully responsible for their microfrontend, from development to deployment and maintenance, leading to clearer responsibilities and greater accountability.

## Benefits of Monorepo

A Monorepo is a code management strategy where all projects and modules of an organization are stored in a single repository. When combined with Microfrontends, a Monorepo offers the following benefits:

- **Easy Code Sharing:** Code and dependencies can be shared seamlessly between microfrontends within the same repository, reducing duplication and simplifying dependency management.
- **Unified Build and Deployment:** A Monorepo allows for the establishment of consistent build and deployment pipelines for all microfrontends, ensuring uniformity and ease of management.
- **Centralized Version Management:** Managing versions of libraries and modules becomes easier when all code resides in one place.
- **Simplified Refactoring:** Large-scale changes involving multiple microfrontends can be performed consistently and tracked more easily within a single repository.
- **Improved Observability and Debugging:** With all code centralized, tracking errors and debugging across the entire application can become more straightforward.

## Benefits of Module Federation

Module Federation is a powerful feature of Webpack 5 that allows separate JavaScript applications (the microfrontends) to share code and dependencies with each other at runtime. The benefits of using Module Federation in a Microfrontend architecture include:

- **Runtime Component and Logic Sharing:** Microfrontends can directly consume components and logic from other microfrontends without requiring a rebuild or redeployment of the entire application.
- **Reduced Bundle Size:** Shared dependencies can be shared between microfrontends, reducing the overall bundle size of the application and improving loading performance.
- **Seamless Updates:** Changes in a shared module can be reflected almost instantly in consuming microfrontends (depending on configuration).
- **Smooth Integration:** Module Federation enables the seamless integration of microfrontends built with different frameworks within the same page.
- **Independent Deployment with Shared Dependencies:** Microfrontends can be deployed independently without worrying about synchronizing shared dependencies (if configured correctly).

✨ Your new, shiny [Nx workspace](https://nx.dev) is almost ready ✨.

[Learn more about this workspace setup and its capabilities](https://nx.dev/getting-started/intro#learn-nx?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) or run `npx nx graph` to visually explore what was created. Now, let's get you up to speed!

## Finish your CI setup

[Click here to finish setting up your workspace!](https://cloud.nx.app/connect/McQeyNObbd)

## Run tasks

To run tasks with Nx use:

```sh
npx nx <target> <project-name>
```

For example:

```sh
npx nx build myproject
```

These targets are either [inferred automatically](https://nx.dev/concepts/inferred-tasks?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) or defined in the `project.json` or `package.json` files.

[More about running tasks in the docs &raquo;](https://nx.dev/features/run-tasks?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects)

## Add new projects

While you could add new projects to your workspace manually, you might want to leverage [Nx plugins](https://nx.dev/concepts/nx-plugins?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) and their [code generation](https://nx.dev/features/generate-code?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) feature.

To install a new plugin you can use the `nx add` command. Here's an example of adding the React plugin:

```sh
npx nx add @nx/react
```

Use the plugin's generator to create new projects. For example, to create a new React app or library:

```sh
# Generate an app
npx nx g @nx/react:app demo

# Generate a library
npx nx g @nx/react:lib some-lib
```

You can use `npx nx list` to get a list of installed plugins. Then, run `npx nx list <plugin-name>` to learn about more specific capabilities of a particular plugin. Alternatively, [install Nx Console](https://nx.dev/getting-started/editor-setup?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) to browse plugins and generators in your IDE.

[Learn more about Nx plugins &raquo;](https://nx.dev/concepts/nx-plugins?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) | [Browse the plugin registry &raquo;](https://nx.dev/plugin-registry?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects)

[Learn more about Nx on CI](https://nx.dev/ci/intro/ci-with-nx#ready-get-started-with-your-provider?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects)

## Install Nx Console

Nx Console is an editor extension that enriches your developer experience. It lets you run tasks, generate code, and improves code autocompletion in your IDE. It is available for VSCode and IntelliJ.
